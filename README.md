# Python-Just-ETF-Scraper
This program is a web scraper for the JustETF website, developed in Python. The program downloads the HTML page of a selected ETF using its ISIN and then proceeds to parse it to extract the most important data.
This program is entirely open-source and can be used to implement APIs. 
However, it is not highly time-efficient and was written in Python with the future intention of transforming it into a Telegram bot. 
The strings used for parsing the file are in Italian so the program works with Italian datas, as the program downloads the Italian version of the page. 
If you wish to adapt it to other languages, modify the strings accordingly.
