# Python-Just-ETF-Scraper
This program is a web scraper for the JustETF website, developed in Python. The program downloads the HTML page of a selected ETF using its ISIN and then proceeds to parse it to extract the most important data.
This program is entirely open-source and can be used to implement APIs. 
However, it is not highly time-efficient and was written in Python with the future intention of transforming it into a Telegram bot. 
There are two versions of the software: the Italian one and the English one. 
Only these two languages are supported, if you wish to adapt it to other languages, modify the split strings accordingly.
